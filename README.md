# Solo Project

The Restaurant Reservation System is a web-based application developed using Node.js for the backend, HTML, CSS, Javascripts for the frontend, and MySQL for database management. 

## Features

 ● Login/Registration System using secure password handling with hashing
 ● Each user has a unique profile.
  
 ● Displays Restaurants home page, menu and various others in a very modern and classy manner.

## How to Run

to create package.json, use this code:
npm init -y

then type this code:
npm install express mysql2 cors body-parser

to run code:
node server.js
and server.js file should be ther right under root directory

eg:
project-root/
├── server.js
└── public/
    └── index.html

Type these code in command line/terminal.

use code:
node server.js 
to set up localhost connection.

## Future fixes to be made

- User password should be more secure (even if its hashed), for eg: should be given criteria for password like 5 characters minimum etc.
- After user logs in, recent reservations of that particular user to be shown.
- Various pop up messages to be shown should be more clean and within the webpage.
